# Intro

This is the first year that I'm trying to publish something on or for the web for the month of October. Webtober has been a good opportunity to hack on some projects and work on my blog! See what I did last week [here](/posts/2025-10-14-webtober-week3/)

## Projects

This past week and change, I've spent most of my time working [music tagger](https://pub.teukka.tech/music/), an application for adding tags and descriptions to music from streaming services. I've been frustrated with the lack of organization options present in Spotify. When I create a new playlist for myself or for a friend, I usually have a vibe or theme in my mind. It can be hard to then scour through songs and albums that aren't already in a playlist with a similar theme. Music tagger allows you to paste in the link from Spotify or Tidal and then categorize the song/album as you wish.

Music tagger was also an opportunity to work on a non-trival sized Go application, which helped me learn a lot more about the language and was very fun! The application is far from complete (I really don't like the name :p), but you, dear reader, are free to use it and send me feature requests or bug reports! I will be updating it according to my needs and feedback I get from others.
