# Intro

This is the first year that I'm trying to publish something on or for the web for the month of October. Webtober has been a good opportunity to hack on some projects and work on my blog! See what I did last week [here](/posts/2025-10-07-webtober/)

## Projects

Here's a breakdown of what I did in the second week:

- Made an app for creating energy/aura/vibe spheres: https://tools.teukka.tech/spheres/
- Made a post showcasing [some of my photos](/photos/california-35mm/) I took in California a year ago
- Worked on integrating ATProto logins to a yet unreleased side project
- Made the week in review blog post.

I did miss a day this week, but that's life! I enjoyed making the spheres app a lot, and might add some more features or do a similar project this week.
