# Intro

This is the first year that I'm trying to publish something on or for the web for the month of October. Webtober has been a good opportunity to hack on some projects and work on my blog! See what I did last week [here](/posts/2025-10-14-webtober/)

## Projects

Here's a breakdown of what I did in the third week:

- Spent a lot of time on a project that I will hopefully release at the end of this week!
- Made the week in review blog post.

I've been working on a project to help me better organize and categorize the music I listen to on Spotify. I've long felt that playlists are a bad way to organize music since I prefer to listen to whole albums. This project will allow you to add tags and descriptions to songs and albums so that you can easily find music again that fits a certain mood or feeling.
