# Intro

This is the first year that I'm trying to publish something on or for the web for the month of October. Webtober has been a good opportunity to hack on some projects and work on my blog!

## Projects

Here's a breakdown of what I did in the first week:

- Updated my website to include a [feeds page](https://teukka.tech/feeds) that shows which RSS feeds to which I'm subscribed.
    - This will automatically pull updates from my RSS reader server and publish them on my blog.
- Created a [Firefox Plugin](https://github.com/jamestthompson3/pagenotes) that allows you to save a bit of highlighted text on a page and navigate to it using [text fragments](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Fragment/Text_fragments).
- Added a way to add a note to a saved highlight in the extension.
- Two days of restructuring how photos are presented in my blog.
- Writing this blog post!

I've tried choose projects that I can get done in an hour or two so that it is easier to get something done.
