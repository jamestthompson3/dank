In a previous article we’ve talked about how you can avoid rewriting a library in Rust when you don’t need to. But what about the times when you really do need to? In most languages you’d need to rewrite the entire library from the ground up, waiting until the port is almost finished before you can start seeing results. These sorts of ports tend to be quite expensive and error-prone, and often they’ll fail midway and you’ll have nothing to show for your effort.
