"Like punning, programming is a play on words." -Alan Perlis - “To the man who only has a hammer, everything he encounters begins to look like a nail.” ― Abraham Maslow Word processors have monopolized the domain of text composition for the last quarter century. At their core, these programs involve text entry at the cursor, but with this function come a peripheral of features: formatting, grammar and spell checking, support for annotation. However, the essential functionality is simple: move the cursor with the mouse or the arrow keys and type or delete letters at the cursor.
