When I launched my Patreon, I vowed to explain how computers work. But in 2019, computers rarely work in isolation. So let's take the time to write a few articles about how computers talk to each other. The history of network protocols and standards is long and complicated. Starting with a comprehensive review would prove quite tedious, especially if such a review was done in isolation from modern use. So, instead, as we did with files, we'll start by accomplishing concrete tasks and work our way back to understand which protocols are involved and how they fit together.
