When WebAssembly was first shipped it was an MVP which, while minimal, has spawned a huge number of exciting projects which work today across all major browsers. Rust has capitalized on the wasm MVP’s success as well with tools like wasm-bindgen and wasm-pack by making the MVP feel less minimal. WebAssembly is yet more ambitious, though! Since inception it’s always been intended to extend the WebAssembly specification with new features and functionality.
