All software essentially deals in simulation. Even that which supposedly interacts with “real” things, like an inventory system, is actually a simulation of the inventory system designed to be more easily manipulated by the software operator.

Therefore all software engineers are simluationists, or creators of an alternate reality whose ties and influences to the physical reality which they inhabit vary in strength.
