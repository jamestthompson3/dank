              applications to react to events and data streams in real time.
              This means you can skip life cycle methods like
              <code>componentDidMount</code> and
              <code>componentDidUpdate</code> when checking for changes in your
              application state. If you are already familiar with reactive
              programming, then hopefully this post can give you more insights
              on how it can dovetail seamlessly with React using the recompose
              library.

              <h3>Task</h3>
              <p>
                While learning about reactive programming in the context of
                React, I found a lot of great material, but not many tutorials
                outside of simple data fetching and counting. Here we will build
                a set of three lists. The first list contains users, while the
                other two containers list their likes and dislikes.
              </p>
              <p>
                Clicking on a user should then load their likes and dislikes
                list and change the URL to denote which user is currently
                selected. If no user is specified in the the URL, then the first
                user on the list should be chosen automatically. Likes and
                dislikes should also be able to be added, deleted, and edited.
              </p>
              <h3>Tools</h3>
              <p>
                The main tools we will be using are

                >. Both are utility libraries that help you harness the power of
                reactive programming. I would suggest looking through the docs
                of both libraries to get acquainted with their usage, but I will
                also explain how to use them in the context of building a UI in
                React.
              </p>
              <h3>Why</h3>
              <p>
                UI design is supposed to feel snappy and reactive, and reactive
                programming allows us to change UI elements according to the
                flow of our data. Unlike in redux, we don‚Äôt have to update our
                data store, wait for the update to propagate, check to see if
                the update is finished, and finally update our UI to reflect the
                changes. With reactive programming, we can push changes to data
                streams and our components instantly react to these changes.
              </p>
              <p>
                As our applications grow in size, so can the state management.
                The result is a large state object which needs to be traversed
                and updated even when you are only using a small part of it for
                the current page or view. In many cases, this data can be kept
                locally and can be ephemeral, no longer taking up space when the
                user navigates away from the page.

          <h3>First steps</h3>
          <p>
            The first thing we need to do in this project is to set up recompose
            to work with the observable configuration used by RXJS. This is done
            by importing the function <code>setObservableConfig</code> from
            recompose, and passing it the <code>from</code> utility from rxjs.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/jamestthompson3/acf5d8bc2e7949dd7676220123d481bc.js.js"></script>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Now that we have recompose configured to work with RXJS, we can
            start making prop streams for our component to consume. Let‚Äôs first
            start with a <code>load</code> stream which will fetch our users
            from the backend and pass the response ‚Äî as well as any other props
            received ‚Äî to the next stream.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/jamestthompson3/05a20ca0596d5ff675d6b5db4a37351a.js"></script>
          </figure>
          <p>Let‚Äôs break this down line by line.</p>
          <p>
            First, we are importing a few operators from rxjs, so let‚Äôs discuss
            what they do and why we need them. <code>switchMap</code> and
            <code>map</code> allow us to map values to other functions and
            components. <code>switchMap</code> takes an observable and flattens
            it, allowing us to pass just its values to the next function and not
            the observable itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following operators, <code>tap</code>, <code>catchError</code>,
            and <code>startWith</code>, help us with debugging and allows us to
            give the user information about the state of the application.
            <code>tap</code> takes and observable, performs a side effect, and
            returns a copy of the original observable.
          </p>
          <h4>Using <code>tap</code> to debug observables</h4>
          <figure>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/jamestthompson3/78b4029c395f3277b0a6808dd153f96f.js"></script>
            <figcaption>
              Using tap to peer into the Observable stream
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            By using <code>tap</code>, we can log out the response we receive
            from the backend without having to worry about changing anything in
            our stream. Using the <code>startWith</code> and
            <code>catchError</code> operators help us communicate the status of
            the application to users by giving us the ability to do conditional
            rendering based on it‚Äôs current state. We will go into the
            implementation of this later.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that we understand what the operators we are using are able to
            do, let‚Äôs step through the load stream logic. You will notice that
            the variable <code>load</code> itself is the result of the
            <code>mapPropsStream</code> function taken from
            <code>recompose</code> this takes as an argument a function which
            receives a stream of props (streams are denoted by the suffix
            <code>$</code> for clarity, but that does not have any syntactic
            meaning) which can then be piped through our logical operators.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here is where <code>switchMap</code> becomes very useful. Since
            React can‚Äôt render anything with an Observable object, we need to
            flatten our props stream so that we get only the values of that
            stream. Those values are the actual props we need to render our
            component. So we flatten the stream and map it to our function which
            fetches the users from the backend. You can use
            <code>props</code> here to pass any additional arguments to your
            function that fetches the data, but since we‚Äôre faking it here, we
            don‚Äôt need to pass anything. Finally, our request returns a
            <code>users</code> array which we then map to an object which passes
            along the <code>props</code>, <code>users</code>, and signals a
            successful request by setting <code>status</code> to
            <code>&#39;SUCCESS&#39;</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may have noticed that we use <code>tap</code> here as well to
            call the function <code>setUserList</code>, which is contained in
            the props passed to the load stream. This, combined with the ternary
            check of <code>isEmpty(props.userList</code> will help us prevent
            unnecessarily re-fetching the data. If we have the data, we just
            want to return it without any manipulation.
          </p>
          <h4>Using streams to handle DOM¬†events</h4>
          <p>
            Let‚Äôs create a second props stream which handles choosing a user
            from the list and setting them as a selected user:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/15272b3d3b0d4845c4b41931c7c08a8d.js"></script>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Much like in our <code>load</code> stream, we want to create a
            stream of props using recompose‚Äôs
            <code>mapPropsStream</code> function. However, instead of directly
            switchMapping the props, we want to create two variables ‚Äî a stream
            and a handler ‚Äî using another utility function from recompose,
            <code>createEventHandler</code>.
            <code>createEventHandler</code> will, as the name implies, create a
            handler and a corresponding stream which you can then assign to
            React events such as <code>onChange</code>, <code>onClick</code>,
            etc. The values from that event will then be passed into the stream
            which you can then pipe, map, and whatever else you need. In our
            case, we want to flatten both the incoming props stream and the
            stream from the event and produce a single object.
          </p>
          <p>
            Taking our props, we want to check to see if there is a user
            specified in the URL. In this project,
            <code>react-router-dom</code> is being used so we find the user
            param in <code>props.match.params.user</code>. But where is the
            <code>Route</code> to pass the <code>match</code> prop to this
            stream?!? Don‚Äôt worry, we will get there, just know that for now,
            <code>selectUser</code> will be passed the props from react-router‚Äôs
            <code>Route</code> component. Now that we have our user from the
            URL, we want to start our stream with either that user, or the first
            user in our <code>userList</code>. If we don‚Äôt have the
            <code>userList</code> yet, we just want to start with
            <code>null</code>. Then we simply pipe the
            <code>selectedUser</code> through the stream and return an object
            which contains all props passed to <code>selectUser</code> as well
            as our <code>userSelect</code> function.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to use the two prop stream we just created, we need to make
            a component which will take the props from both streams and render
            our list element
          </p>
          <figure>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/jamestthompson3/3007a6d6309893c53543be60022d5754.js"></script>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The component itself is quite simple, it just takes the props,
            checks to see if the right user is in the URL, and if not, pushes
            the correct user there. Next, it takes our <code>userList</code>,
            maps through it and returns a list item for each user in the list
            and adds some conditional styling if the user is currently selected.
            If the request is still ongoing, then it displays a loading
            component. Notice that we pass the <code>userSelect</code> function
            to our list items to use as an <code>onClick</code> handler. The
            user that is passed to <code>userSelect</code> is then pushed to the
            <code>selectUser</code> stream.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order for this component to have access to all these props, it‚Äôs
            time for some functional programming beauty. Using the
            <code>compose</code> function from recompose, we create a new
            element which streams all the props from both <code>load</code>,
            <code>selectUser</code>, and react-router to the
            <code>IndexPage</code> element. It is here we will also create the
            function <code>setUserlist</code> and the <code>userList</code> prop
            we saw in our <code>load</code> stream.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/jamestthompson3/050101c8a8d6e1fcc713c07b5bb7df66.js"></script>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The functions <code>withState</code> and
            <code>withHandlers</code> allow us to keep persistent data and
            manipulate that data inside our streams.
            <code>withState</code> accepts three arguments, the name of the item
            in state, the name of the function used to update the state, and the
            inital state. <code>withHandlers</code> receive the function
            specified in <code>withState</code> and can accept as many handlers
            as you need. In our case, we just need one handler which will take
            the <code>users</code> array from our fetch function and set the
            <code>userList</code> state property to that array. We also pass the
            <code>withRouter</code> function so that our component and event
            streams have access to router props such as <code>match</code> and
            <code>history</code>.
          </p>
          <p>Time to put the first steps together</p>
          <figure>

          <h3>Next Steps</h3>
          <p>
            Now that we have our list of users, it is time to create a component
            which will display their lists of likes and dislikes. Here, we can
            take advantage of more recompose helper functions,
            <code>withContext</code> and <code>getContext</code>. These will
            prevent us from being trapped in passed-down props hell. Since we
            will be creating more handlers to update the list of users, there
            will be many functions which we will want to pass down to our
            components that display the likes and dislikes which could result in
            something like this:
          </p>
          <p>
            All of these props would then have to be continually passed down
            until they reach the components that actually consume them. That is
            crazy! By using <code>withContext</code> and
            <code>getContext</code>, we can pass down the props we need and
            consume them in any child of our <code>IndexPage</code> component.
            So, let‚Äôs create our handlers:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/jamestthompson3/f0d4851c2cd420b54071b4eeb2fc3068.js"></script>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Here, are a few basic functions that will update our state after
            making a request to a fictitious endpoint. We can now pass these
            handlers and our selected user down to child components using
            <code>withContext</code>
          </p>
          <figure>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/jamestthompson3/55a4365059c8ad4633e7d6394752e4ef.js"></script>
          </figure>
          <p>
            <code>withContext</code> takes two arguments, the first being the
            <code>childContextTypes</code>, and the second being a function
            which returns the props to be passed as context. In our case, we
            want to pass the selected user and our state handler functions down
            as context. We get these props by placing our
            <code>withContext</code> function as an argument of our
            <code>compose</code> function like this:
          </p>

            We are now able to consume these props as context in any child
            component!
          </p>
          <h3>Using context in child components</h3>
          <p>
            Let‚Äôs use the context we just created to display users‚Äô likes and
            dislikes and add a simple interface to add and remove data.
          </p>
          <figure>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/jamestthompson3/39f28c84bed7ad28fdf8738f1bbdba61.js"></script>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The above component simply takes the user and their likes from
            context and displays them in a list. This component also allows
            users to delete a like by clicking on an icon which calls our
            <code>deleteUser</code> function we defined earlier. Let‚Äôs add a
            modal that will allow users to add an item to the list by clicking
            on the <code>add</code> icon.
          </p>
          <p>
            It‚Äôs time to create more DOM event driven streams. The first stream
            we want to create will be one to open and close the form modal:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/jamestthompson3/506b136a0aee1a044d3e0516faf63f65.js"></script>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Handling a toggle event is quite simple, we specify whether we want
            the toggle to be on or off, and then use <code>scan</code> ‚Äî a
            function that applies an accumulator over the stream ( similar to
            Array.reduce ) ‚Äî to toggle the state. We then return all passed
            props as well as the current state of the modal and the handler
            itself.
          </p>
          <p>Dealing with text input is a bit trickier:</p>
          <figure>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/jamestthompson3/d5a2aa074f22a92cccd30c74295375c7.js"></script>
          </figure>
          <p>
            In the above snippet, we take the stream produced by our event
            handler ( in this case typing in a text input ) and we create a new
            stream composed of only the value of <code>event.target</code>. It
            is also important to note that we must use
            <code>startWith</code> here or else this stream will not be
            subscribed to and our component which uses this stream will not be
            rendered.
          </p>
          <p>
            To access these functions in our List component, we must compose
            them together like so:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/jamestthompson3/92834e22fa5fd71433cdf74ffa873435.js"></script>
          </figure>
          <p>
            By using composable streams, we are able to create a nice modal form
            which takes text input and adds it to the list of user‚Äôs likes. Here
            is it‚Äôs parent component:
          </p>
          <figure>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/jamestthompson3/9e33feca7fb966852a2bc7c65e6a062f.js"></script>
          </figure>
          <p>And the modal itself:</p>
          <figure>
            <script src="https://gist.github.com/jamestthompson3/87c6ba9100f5ae1c008bc3b0295356ea.js"></script>
          </figure>
          <p>
            Doing the same for the user‚Äôs dislikes gives us two lists that can
            be modified by the user.

              <h3>Wrap up</h3>
              <p>
                Observable streams are a great way of managing data flows in
                components. While some of the things outlined here might be a
                bit overkill, I wanted to illustrate that composable streams
                work well in many use cases. Breaking up logic into streams can
                help create separate and composable pieces of logic that can
                stem from complicated UIs. Components that subscribe to changes
                in the streams are able to react to one source of truth rather
                than having to check for side-effects in lifecycle methods such
                as <code>componentDidUpdate</code>. I think that they are a
                great way to remove some of the anti-patterns we see in React
                components and to avoid the performance costs of a large Redux
                store.
