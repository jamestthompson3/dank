Searching online, I found a few different ideas on how to address the problem, but most of them involved replacing the copper heating element. I reached out to Moccamaster and they told me to contact my local distributor, which I did, but heard nothing back. I got tired of waiting and decided to try and fix it myself.</description></item><item><title>Misc. 35mm Film Photos</title><link>https://teukka.tech/photos/misc-35mm/</link><pubDate>Thu, 02 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>taylor@teukka.tech (taylor thompson)</author><guid>https://teukka.tech/photos/misc-35mm/</guid><description> Quiet cup of tea Winter new Berchtesgaden, Germany Winter hike, Finland Wild Heather, Scotland Signpost on top of Gamskarkogel, Austria Top of the mountain.

I want to discuss my vision for the tool and ideas around knowledge management. The main goal of Tendril Wiki is to collapse the tools I use for managing information into a single, unified platform. The functionality in Tendril Wiki arises from my own personal needs or from features I&amp;rsquo;ve seen other platforms / tools implement and wanted for myself.</description></item><item><title>Lessons from Building Tendril Wiki</title><link>https://teukka.tech/posts/tendril-wiki-lessons/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>taylor@teukka.tech (taylor thompson)</author><guid>https://teukka.tech/posts/tendril-wiki-lessons/</guid><description>Over the past year and half, I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a knowledge management tool called, Tendril Wiki. I&amp;rsquo;ve used it to organize my thoughts and catalogue information both at work and in my personal life. Tendril Wiki has served as a place for me to experiment with tooling ideas, gain more experience using the Rust programming language, and copy concepts from other tools for thought. After 18 months, I want to reflect on what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned and where I can improve.</description></item><item><title>Summer 2022</title><link>https://teukka.tech/photos/summer-2022/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>taylor@teukka.tech (taylor thompson)</author><guid>https://teukka.tech/photos/summer-2022/</guid><description>In Summer 2022, I took a trip with my wife around Europe.

The plan is to continuously add ideas and maybe even spin some of them off into their own blog posts.
SYSTEMICS
The ideas that most of the things we interact with each day is part of a system. Ecosystems, cities, digital applications, companies, societies are all systems and there for express systemic behaviors.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://teukka.tech/updates/79413/</link><pubDate>Sun, 16 Jan 2022 22:03:33 +0000</pubDate><author>taylor@teukka.tech (taylor thompson)</author><guid>https://teukka.tech/updates/79413/</guid><description>Twitter (or decentralized alternatives) is a great interstitial journaling tool</description></item><item><title/><link>https://teukka.tech/updates/75816/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 21:03:36 +0000</pubDate><author>taylor@teukka.tech (taylor thompson)</author><guid>https://teukka.tech/updates/75816/</guid><description>Using the idea of Leary&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Quantum Universe&amp;rdquo;, where all matter can be reduced to a digital 1/0 representation, I wonder what the compression ratio for memories in our brains is, and what (lossy) algorithm is used to achieve it.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://teukka.tech/updates/35615/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Nov 2021 09:53:35 +0000</pubDate><author>taylor@teukka.tech (taylor thompson)</author><guid>https://teukka.tech/updates/35615/</guid><description>All software essentially deals in simulation. Even that which supposedly interacts with “real” things, like an inventory system, is actually a simulation of the inventory system designed to be more easily manipulated by the software operator.
Therefore all software engineers are simluationists, or creators of an alternate reality whose ties and influences to the physical reality which they inhabit vary in strength.</description></item><item><title>Neovim Tip, Smarter Path</title><link>https://teukka.tech/posts/vimtip-path/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>taylor@teukka.tech (taylor thompson)</author><guid>https://teukka.tech/posts/vimtip-path/</guid><description>Intro Fuzzy finders can be a good tool for navigating files in a codebase, but they don&amp;rsquo;t give you the same functionality as a properly set path option in vim. Key mappings like gf, [i, [d, and commands like :find depend on having your path set correctly to find the file you&amp;rsquo;re searching for. Using the :find command also gives us the ability to tab complete a file name, a feature which fuzzy finders do not offer.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://teukka.tech/updates/24821/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Nov 2021 06:53:41 +0000</pubDate><author>taylor@teukka.tech (taylor thompson)</author><guid>https://teukka.tech/updates/24821/</guid><description>Indieweb is the type of federated web3 I want to see rather than the introduction of artificial scarcity and an ecologically ruinous accounting system that encompasses current blockchain tech.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://teukka.tech/updates/56596/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 15:43:16 +0000</pubDate><author>taylor@teukka.tech (taylor thompson)</author><guid>https://teukka.tech/updates/56596/</guid><description>Computers are excellent tools for inducing altered states of consciousness.

Discovering peers directly removes the necessity of a centralized server architecture, reducing the number of network jumps your packets require to share information with each other. Peer discovery can be used in: discovering microservices in the same docker network or kubernetes cluster, file sharing (like airdrop and bittorrent), and peer to peer gaming.</description></item><item><title>Javascript Quick Tip -- Browser Notifications</title><link>https://teukka.tech/posts/2020-05-16-notifications/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>taylor@teukka.tech (taylor thompson)</author><guid>https://teukka.tech/posts/2020-05-16-notifications/</guid><description>Let &amp;lsquo;Em Know While notifications are one of the browser features that are often abused and lead to obnoxious spam, there are still use cases where notifications enhance the experience of your web application.

The Service Worker API is a powerful tool for providing better offline experiences, push notifications, and background syncing for web applications. Like me, you may be familiar with service workers from the role they play in creating Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), or from seeing them registered as part of the build output of create-react-app. While this automatic output from build tools such as create-react-app is very useful in getting started with PWAs, using the Service Worker API is much more beneficial to your application when tailored to your use cases.</description></item><item><title>A Brief Look at Javascript Proxies</title><link>https://teukka.tech/posts/2020-02-01-proxies/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>taylor@teukka.tech (taylor thompson)</author><guid>https://teukka.tech/posts/2020-02-01-proxies/</guid><description>Proxies Javascript Proxies are a powerful concept in ES6.

Microservice Client The first example comes from a request management client that uses a JSON schema to validate incoming requests and route them to other services.</description></item><item><title>Neovim Tip, GitLens</title><link>https://teukka.tech/posts/2020-01-28-vimtip-gitlens/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>taylor@teukka.tech (taylor thompson)</author><guid>https://teukka.tech/posts/2020-01-28-vimtip-gitlens/</guid><description>Intro GitLens is a VSCode plugin that, among other things, allows you to see the time, commit author, and commit message of the current line. With a little help from to the neovim api and our shell, it we can recreate this functionality in a few lines of lua code.
The Code -- in utils.lua local M = {} local api = vim.api function M.blameVirtText() local ft = vim.fn.expand(&amp;#39;%:h:t&amp;#39;) -- get the current file extension if ft == &amp;#39;&amp;#39; then -- if we are in a scratch buffer or unknown filetype return end if ft == &amp;#39;bin&amp;#39; then -- if we are in nvim&amp;#39;s terminal window return end api.</description></item><item><title>Using LibUV in Neovim</title><link>https://teukka.tech/posts/2020-01-07-vimloop/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>taylor@teukka.tech (taylor thompson)</author><guid>https://teukka.tech/posts/2020-01-07-vimloop/</guid><description>Off The Main Loop: Async Actions within Neovim Neovim embeds the libuv library in the editor and exposes lua (and to some extent vimscript through the jobstart function) bindings for interacting with the library&amp;rsquo;s API. This allows actions in the editor to happen asynchronously, keeping the main editor loop clear for user input. What this means practically for users is that actions which take a long time such as grepping through large projects, generating ctags, or linting can now be done in the background without blocking the user&amp;rsquo;s ability to keep editing text.</description></item><item><title>From init.vim to init.lua</title><link>https://teukka.tech/posts/2019-12-19-luanvim/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>taylor@teukka.tech (taylor thompson)</author><guid>https://teukka.tech/posts/2019-12-19-luanvim/</guid><description>Why Lua? Neovim has an embedded lua 5.1 runtime which is used to create faster and more powerful extensions of your favorite editor. In the Neovim charter, it lists one of its goals as developing a first-class lua scripting alternative to VimL. One of the reasons for doing this is that VimL is a slow interpreted language with almost no optimizations. Much of the time spent in vim startup and in actions from plugins that can block the main loop in the editor is in parsing and executing vimscript.</description></item><item><title>Central Europe</title><link>https://teukka.tech/photos/central-europe/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Nov 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>taylor@teukka.tech (taylor thompson)</author><guid>https://teukka.tech/photos/central-europe/</guid><description>In Fall 2019, I took a trip around Central Europe.

The ability to fetch data from some service and display it to users is an important part of building a framework to support these applications. In order for our components to do this, we need to refactor. Our component calls mount when we want to render it on the page, but this function only serves to attach styles and event handlers to the component, not fetch data asynchronously.</description></item><item><title>Build Your Own Frontend Framework Part 1</title><link>https://teukka.tech/posts/2019-09-15-byoff-part-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>taylor@teukka.tech (taylor thompson)</author><guid>https://teukka.tech/posts/2019-09-15-byoff-part-1/</guid><description>Part One, Basic Component Components will be the basic building blocks of our frontend framework. Components will allow modular composition and encapsulation. The first component implementation will be rather naive, but that&amp;rsquo;s alright since its implementation will evolve over time. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with creating a Component class:
const COOL_COMPONENT = Symbol(&amp;#34;component&amp;#34;); class Component { constructor(element, args = {}) { this.$$typeof = COOL_COMPONENT; this.el = document.createElement(element); this.args = args; } } Breaking this down:</description></item><item><title>Build Your Own Frontend Framework, Introduction</title><link>https://teukka.tech/posts/2019-09-09-build-your-own-frontend-framework/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>taylor@teukka.tech (taylor thompson)</author><guid>https://teukka.tech/posts/2019-09-09-build-your-own-frontend-framework/</guid><description>Welcome to build your own frontend framework project!

For many, Vim seems archaic, under-featured, or even intimidating. I hope to illustrate that Vim none of those things, but is in fact a great editor for nearly every development environment.
I want to focus on three common tasks where Vim helps you be more productive without leaving your editor.</description></item></channel></rss>
