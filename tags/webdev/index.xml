It makes it so easy to just focus on the fun stuff without worrying about all the tooling you need to generate really great static sites. It&amp;rsquo;s also super fast!</description></item><item><title>Javascript Quick Tip -- Browser Notifications</title><link>https://teukka.tech/posts/2020-05-16-notifications/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>taylor@teukka.tech (taylor thompson)</author><guid>https://teukka.tech/posts/2020-05-16-notifications/</guid><description>Let &amp;lsquo;Em Know While notifications are one of the browser features that are often abused and lead to obnoxious spam, there are still use cases where notifications enhance the experience of your web application. Modern browsers (with the exception of iOS Safari), support two types of notifications: push, and web. This post discusses only web notifications, since they do not require registration on a server, or the use of a service worker (although they can be used with both).</description></item><item><title>Build a Better Web with Service Workers</title><link>https://teukka.tech/posts/2020-03-07-serviceworker/</link><pubDate>Sat, 07 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>taylor@teukka.tech (taylor thompson)</author><guid>https://teukka.tech/posts/2020-03-07-serviceworker/</guid><description>Working Hard, or Hardly Working? The Service Worker API is a powerful tool for providing better offline experiences, push notifications, and background syncing for web applications. Like me, you may be familiar with service workers from the role they play in creating Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), or from seeing them registered as part of the build output of create-react-app. While this automatic output from build tools such as create-react-app is very useful in getting started with PWAs, using the Service Worker API is much more beneficial to your application when tailored to your use cases.</description></item><item><title>A Brief Look at Javascript Proxies</title><link>https://teukka.tech/posts/2020-02-01-proxies/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>taylor@teukka.tech (taylor thompson)</author><guid>https://teukka.tech/posts/2020-02-01-proxies/</guid><description>Proxies Javascript Proxies are a powerful concept in ES6. They give developers more control over JS objects, paving the way for declarative API design. I am going to show some examples of how use proxies to extend the functionality of traditional Javascript objects and why they are useful in understanding the flow of data inside your programs.
Microservice Client The first example comes from a request management client that uses a JSON schema to validate incoming requests and route them to other services.</description></item><item><title>Build Your Own Frontend Framework Part 2, Data Fetching</title><link>https://teukka.tech/posts/2019-10-01-byoff-part-2/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>taylor@teukka.tech (taylor thompson)</author><guid>https://teukka.tech/posts/2019-10-01-byoff-part-2/</guid><description>Part Two, Data Fetching on Mount Asynchronous actions are essential in any modern web application. The ability to fetch data from some service and display it to users is an important part of building a framework to support these applications. In order for our components to do this, we need to refactor. Our component calls mount when we want to render it on the page, but this function only serves to attach styles and event handlers to the component, not fetch data asynchronously.</description></item><item><title>Build Your Own Frontend Framework Part 1</title><link>https://teukka.tech/posts/2019-09-15-byoff-part-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 15 Sep 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>taylor@teukka.tech (taylor thompson)</author><guid>https://teukka.tech/posts/2019-09-15-byoff-part-1/</guid><description>Part One, Basic Component Components will be the basic building blocks of our frontend framework. Components will allow modular composition and encapsulation. The first component implementation will be rather naive, but that&amp;rsquo;s alright since its implementation will evolve over time. Let&amp;rsquo;s start with creating a Component class:
const COOL_COMPONENT = Symbol(&amp;#34;component&amp;#34;); class Component { constructor(element, args = {}) { this.$$typeof = COOL_COMPONENT; this.el = document.createElement(element); this.args = args; } } Breaking this down:</description></item></channel></rss>
