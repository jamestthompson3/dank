The Service Worker API is a powerful tool for providing better offline experiences, push notifications, and background syncing for web applications. Like me, you may be familiar with service workers from the role they play in creating Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), or from seeing them registered as part of the build output of create-react-app. While this automatic output from build tools such as create-react-app is very useful in getting started with PWAs, using the Service Worker API is much more beneficial to your application when tailored to your use cases.</description></item></channel></rss>
