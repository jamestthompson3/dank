&lt;p&gt;This is a running and incomplete list of ideas that have changed the way I thought or interacted
with the world. The plan is to continuously add ideas and maybe even spin some of them off into their

Some of these behaviors such as emergence, unintended consequences, ripple effects, and network effects radically shape our lives and reality.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
