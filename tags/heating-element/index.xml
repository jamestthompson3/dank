&lt;p&gt;I recently purchased a moccamaster second hand and found that it leaked from the heating element at the bottom of the machine. Searching online, I found a few different ideas on how to address the problem, but most of them involved replacing the copper heating element.
I reached out to Moccamaster and they told me to contact my local distributor, which I did, but heard nothing back. I got tired of waiting and decided to try and fix it myself.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
