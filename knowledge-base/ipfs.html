        <div class="tc-tiddler-body tc-reveal"><p>The InterPlanetary file system (IPFS) aims to be not only just a peer to peer file system, but also an infrastructure for the distributed web. It aims to solve the challenge faced by traditional client-server architectures which is &quot;lots of data, available everywhere&quot;. All data in the IPFS is part of the same dataset, represented in a Merkle Directed Acyclic Graph. Each node of the IPFS contains an ID, a public key, and a private key. The function used to hash the node's ID can also be specified and shared, allowing for more a flexible implementation for nodes.</p><p>The IPFS specifies interfaces that need to be met, rather than implementation details, allowing it to operate over a variety of network protocols including TCP, uTP, and overlay networks without IP. To protect against &quot;greedy&quot; nodes (i.e. nodes that only receive data and never seed it), the IPFS has a probabilistic strategy for block exchange which is calculated through the use of a node's &quot;debt ratio&quot;, as expressed by the formula <code>bytes_sent / bytes_received + 1</code>.</p><p>Unlike some distributed ledger systems, nodes in the IPFS do not need to verify the entire ledger history of a peer during the exchange initiation. Instead, only the most recent ledger entries are enough for peers to take advantage of a history of good conduct, and older entries can be garbage collected. Objects and links make up some of the basic data structures of the IPFS:</p><ul><li>Link: has a name, a cryptographic hash of the target data, and the size of the target data</li><li>Object: contains an array of links, and a byte array containing the data for the IPFS block.</li></ul><p>Objects are immutable, which can cause problems when factoring in file system behavior such as renaming a file, or changing its location. To compensate for this, a InterPlanetary Name Space prefix is attached, allowing for human readable names and for the IPFS routing system to map the mutable name to the immutable object.</p><hr><p>- One of the challenges to HTTP is the concept of &quot;lots of data, available everywhere&quot;. Server-Client architectures can be expensive to scale up.</p><p>- All data in IPFS is part of the same dataset</p><p>- SFS -&gt; Self-certifying File Systems. Work similar to HTTPS. Server gives a public key, client validates, they negotiate a secret key, and the all traffic is secured.</p><p>- Nodes
          - contain an ID, public key, and private key.
          - Use flexible hashes with header:  <code>&lt;function code&gt;&lt;digest length&gt;&lt;digest bytes&gt;</code></p><ul><li>Network</li><li>Can operate via uTP</li><li>Doesn't need to operate over IP</li></ul><p>- Use of &quot;debt ratio&quot; to protect against greedy peers</p><p>- No need to verify the entire ledger history -&gt; prevents performance issues</p><p>- Issue of working with large files, how do you split it into blocks and how do you version those blocks?</p><p>Objects are permenant!</p><p>By using the <code>IPNS</code> system, you can map <u>mutable</u> names to <u>immutable</u> objects.</p></div>
