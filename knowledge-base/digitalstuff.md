## Here, There, Everywhere: Dealing with a Digital Rat's Nest

As someone whose organization is chaotic, [Ofer Bergeman](https://is.biu.ac.il/en/bergman) and [Steve Whittaker's](https://sites.google.com/view/stevewhittaker/home) book, _The Science of Managing our Digital Stuff_ appealed to me as a way to learn how to tame a scattered library of digital information across different applications, computers, and cloud file systems. What I expected was a self-help-esque guide to getting organized and being productive. What I got was much better. Bergeman and Whittaker dive deep into the science behind behaviors concerning saving, retrieving, and using saved data; giving valuable insight to both creators and users of software.

For a long time, an organizational struggle of mine has been being able to effectively maintain a growing collection of articles, books, and thoughts. Thankfully in the digital age, retention is easy, but recall is not. Often I'm searching for 'that one post', or 'that one article', or am trying to determine out of which book the quote I'm thinking of came.
