                </h3>
                <p>
                  If you haven’t heard about reactive programming yet, I invite
                  you to pause and get acquainted.

                    >This gist </a
                  >is a great place to get started. Reactive programming allows
                  your applications to react to events and data streams in real
                  time. This means you can skip life cycle methods like
                  <code>componentDidMount</code>
                  and
                  <code>componentDidUpdate</code>
                  when checking for changes in your application state. If you
                  are already familiar with reactive programming, then hopefully
                  this post can give you more insights on how it can dovetail
                  seamlessly with React using the recompose library.

                <p>
                  While learning about reactive programming in the context of
                  React, I found a lot of great material, but not many tutorials
                  outside of simple data fetching and counting. Here we will
                  build a set of three lists. The first list contains users,
                  while the other two containers list their likes and dislikes.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Clicking on a user should then load their likes and dislikes
                  list and change the URL to denote which user is currently
                  selected. If no user is specified in the the URL, then the
                  first user on the list should be chosen automatically. Likes
                  and dislikes should also be able to be added, deleted, and
                  edited.
                </p>

                  of reactive programming. I would suggest looking through the
                  docs of both libraries to get acquainted with their usage, but
                  I will also explain how to use them in the context of building
                  a UI in React.

                <h3>
                  Why
                </h3>
                <p>
                  UI design is supposed to feel snappy and reactive, and
                  reactive programming allows us to change UI elements according
                  to the flow of our data. Unlike in redux, we don’t have to
                  update our data store, wait for the update to propagate, check
                  to see if the update is finished, and finally update our UI to
                  reflect the changes. With reactive programming, we can push
                  changes to data streams and our components instantly react to
                  these changes.
                </p>
                <p id="7532">
                  As our applications grow in size, so can the state management.
                  The result is a large state object which needs to be traversed
                  and updated even when you are only using a small part of it
                  for the current page or view. In many cases, this data can be
                  kept locally and can be ephemeral, no longer taking up space
                  when the user navigates away from the page.

                  First steps
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The first thing we need to do in this project is to set up
                  recompose to work with the observable configuration used by
                  RXJS. This is done by importing the function
                  <code>setObservableConfig</code>
                  from recompose, and passing it the
                  <code>from</code> utility from rxjs.
                </p>
                <figure id="8542">
                  <script src="https://gist.github.com/jamestthompson3/acf5d8bc2e7949dd7676220123d481bc.js.js"></script>
                </figure>
                <p>
                  Now that we have recompose configured to work with RXJS, we
                  can start making prop streams for our component to consume.
                  Let’s first start with a
                  <code>load</code> stream which will fetch our users from the
                  backend and pass the response — as well as any other props
                  received — to the next stream.
                </p>
                <figure id="b01c">
                  <script src="https://gist.github.com/jamestthompson3/05a20ca0596d5ff675d6b5db4a37351a.js"></script>
                </figure>
                <p>
                  Let’s break this down line by line.
                </p>
                <p>
                  First, we are importing a few operators from rxjs, so let’s
                  discuss what they do and why we need them.
                  <code>switchMap</code> and <code>map</code> allow us to map
                  values to other functions and components.
                  <code>switchMap</code> takes an observable and flattens it,
                  allowing us to pass just its values to the next function and
                  not the observable itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The following operators,
                  <code>tap</code>, <code>catchError</code>, and
                  <code>startWith</code>, help us with debugging and allows us
                  to give the user information about the state of the
                  application. <code>tap</code> takes and observable, performs a
                  side effect, and returns a copy of the original observable.
                </p>
                <h4>Using <code>tap</code> to debug observables</h4>
                <figure id="952e">
                  <script src="https://gist.github.com/jamestthompson3/78b4029c395f3277b0a6808dd153f96f.js"></script>
                  <figcaption>
                    Using tap to peer into the Observable stream
                  </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>
                  By using <code>tap</code>, we can log out the response we
                  receive from the backend without having to worry about
                  changing anything in our stream. Using the
                  <code>startWith</code> and
                  <code>catchError</code>
                  operators help us communicate the status of the application to
                  users by giving us the ability to do conditional rendering
                  based on it’s current state. We will go into the
                  implementation of this later.

                  Now that we understand what the operators we are using are
                  able to do, let’s step through the load stream logic. You will
                  notice that the variable
                  <code>load</code> itself is the result of the
                  <code>mapPropsStream</code>
                  function taken from
                  <code>recompose</code> this takes as an argument a function
                  which receives a stream of props (streams are denoted by the
                  suffix <code>$</code> for clarity, but that does not have any
                  syntactic meaning) which can then be piped through our logical
                  operators.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here is where
                  <code>switchMap</code>
                  becomes very useful. Since React can’t render anything with an
                  Observable object, we need to flatten our props stream so that
                  we get only the values of that stream. Those values are the
                  actual props we need to render our component. So we flatten
                  the stream and map it to our function which fetches the users
                  from the backend. You can use
                  <code>props</code> here to pass any additional arguments to
                  your function that fetches the data, but since we’re faking it
                  here, we don’t need to pass anything. Finally, our request
                  returns a <code>users</code> array which we then map to an
                  object which passes along the <code>props</code>,
                  <code>users</code>, and signals a successful request by
                  setting <code>status</code> to <code>&#39;SUCCESS&#39;</code>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You may have noticed that we use
                  <code>tap</code> here as well to call the function
                  <code>setUserList</code>, which is contained in the props
                  passed to the load stream. This, combined with the ternary
                  check of
                  <code>isEmpty(props.userList</code>
                  will help us prevent unnecessarily re-fetching the data. If we
                  have the data, we just want to return it without any
                  manipulation.

                <h4>
                  Using streams to handle DOM events
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Let’s create a second props stream which handles choosing a
                  user from the list and setting them as a selected user:
                </p>
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/15272b3d3b0d4845c4b41931c7c08a8d.js"></script>
                <p>
                  Much like in our
                  <code>load</code> stream, we want to create a stream of props
                  using recompose’s
                  <code>mapPropsStream</code>
                  function. However, instead of directly switchMapping the
                  props, we want to create two variables — a stream and a
                  handler — using another utility function from recompose,
                  <code>createEventHandler</code>.
                  <code>createEventHandler</code>
                  will, as the name implies, create a handler and a
                  corresponding stream which you can then assign to React events
                  such as
                  <code>onChange</code>, <code>onClick</code>, etc. The values
                  from that event will then be passed into the stream which you
                  can then pipe, map, and whatever else you need. In our case,
                  we want to flatten both the incoming props stream and the
                  stream from the event and produce a single object.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Taking our props, we want to check to see if there is a user
                  specified in the URL. In this project,
                  <code>react-router-dom</code>
                  is being used so we find the user param in
                  <code>props.match.params.user</code>. But where is the
                  <code>Route</code> to pass the <code>match</code> prop to this
                  stream?!? Don’t worry, we will get there, just know that for
                  now, <code>selectUser</code> will be passed the props from
                  react-router’s
                  <code>Route</code>
                  component. Now that we have our user from the URL, we want to
                  start our stream with either that user, or the first user in
                  our
                  <code>userList</code>. If we don’t have the
                  <code>userList</code> yet, we just want to start with
                  <code>null</code>. Then we simply pipe the
                  <code>selectedUser</code>
                  through the stream and return an object which contains all
                  props passed to
                  <code>selectUser</code> as well as our
                  <code>userSelect</code>
                  function.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order to use the two prop stream we just created, we need
                  to make a component which will take the props from both
                  streams and render our list element
                </p>
                <figure id="0fb5">
                  <script src="https://gist.github.com/jamestthompson3/3007a6d6309893c53543be60022d5754.js"></script>
                </figure>
                <p>
                  The component itself is quite simple, it just takes the props,
                  checks to see if the right user is in the URL, and if not,
                  pushes the correct user there. Next, it takes our
                  <code>userList</code>, maps through it and returns a list item
                  for each user in the list and adds some conditional styling if
                  the user is currently selected. If the request is still
                  ongoing, then it displays a loading component. Notice that we
                  pass the
                  <code>userSelect</code>
                  function to our list items to use as an
                  <code>onClick</code>
                  handler. The user that is passed to
                  <code>userSelect</code> is then pushed to the
                  <code>selectUser</code>
                  stream.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order for this component to have access to all these props,
                  it’s time for some functional programming beauty. Using the
                  <code>compose</code>
                  function from recompose, we create a new element which streams
                  all the props from both
                  <code>load</code>, <code>selectUser</code>, and react-router
                  to the
                  <code>IndexPage</code>
                  element. It is here we will also create the function
                  <code>setUserlist</code> and the <code>userList</code> prop we
                  saw in our <code>load</code> stream.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The functions
                  <code>withState</code> and
                  <code>withHandlers</code>
                  allow us to keep persistent data and manipulate that data
                  inside our streams.
                  <code>withState</code>
                  accepts three arguments, the name of the item in state, the
                  name of the function used to update the state, and the inital
                  state.
                  <code>withHandlers</code>
                  receive the function specified in
                  <code>withState</code> and can accept as many handlers as you
                  need. In our case, we just need one handler which will take
                  the <code>users</code> array from our fetch function and set
                  the <code>userList</code> state property to that array. We
                  also pass the
                  <code>withRouter</code>
                  function so that our component and event streams have access
                  to router props such as
                  <code>match</code> and <code>history</code>.

                <p>
                  Now that we have our list of users, it is time to create a
                  component which will display their lists of likes and
                  dislikes. Here, we can take advantage of more recompose helper
                  functions,
                  <code>withContext</code> and <code>getContext</code>. These
                  will prevent us from being trapped in passed-down props hell.
                  Since we will be creating more handlers to update the list of
                  users, there will be many functions which we will want to pass
                  down to our components that display the likes and dislikes
                  which could result in something like this:
                </p>
                <p>
                  All of these props would then have to be continually passed
                  down until they reach the components that actually consume
                  them. That is crazy! By using
                  <code>withContext</code> and <code>getContext</code>, we can
                  pass down the props we need and consume them in any child of
                  our
                  <code>IndexPage</code>
                  component. So, let’s create our handlers:
                </p>
                <figure id="bb5a">
                  <script src="https://gist.github.com/jamestthompson3/f0d4851c2cd420b54071b4eeb2fc3068.js"></script>
                </figure>
                <p>
                  Here, are a few basic functions that will update our state
                  after making a request to a fictitious endpoint. We can now
                  pass these handlers and our selected user down to child
                  components using
                  <code>withContext</code>
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                  <code>withContext</code>
                  takes two arguments, the first being the
                  <code>childContextTypes</code>, and the second being a
                  function which returns the props to be passed as context. In
                  our case, we want to pass the selected user and our state
                  handler functions down as context. We get these props by
                  placing our
                  <code>withContext</code>
                  function as an argument of our
                  <code>compose</code>
                  function like this:

                </figure>
                <p>
                  We are now able to consume these props as context in any child
                  component!

                  Let’s use the context we just created to display users’ likes
                  and dislikes and add a simple interface to add and remove
                  data.

                <p>
                  The above component simply takes the user and their likes from
                  context and displays them in a list. This component also
                  allows users to delete a like by clicking on an icon which
                  calls our
                  <code>deleteUser</code>
                  function we defined earlier. Let’s add a modal that will allow
                  users to add an item to the list by clicking on the
                  <code>add</code> icon.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It’s time to create more DOM event driven streams. The first
                  stream we want to create will be one to open and close the
                  form modal:
                </p>

                </figure>
                <p>
                  Handling a toggle event is quite simple, we specify whether we
                  want the toggle to be on or off, and then use
                  <code>scan</code> — a function that applies an accumulator
                  over the stream ( similar to Array.reduce ) — to toggle the
                  state. We then return all passed props as well as the current
                  state of the modal and the handler itself.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Dealing with text input is a bit trickier:

                </figure>
                <p>
                  In the above snippet, we take the stream produced by our event
                  handler ( in this case typing in a text input ) and we create
                  a new stream composed of only the value of
                  <code>event.target</code>. It is also important to note that
                  we must use <code>startWith</code> here or else this stream
                  will not be subscribed to and our component which uses this
                  stream will not be rendered.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To access these functions in our List component, we must
                  compose them together like so:

                <p>
                  By using composable streams, we are able to create a nice
                  modal form which takes text input and adds it to the list of
                  user’s likes. Here is it’s parent component:

                  Doing the same for the user’s dislikes gives us two lists that
                  can be modified by the user.

                  Observable streams are a great way of managing data flows in
                  components. While some of the things outlined here might be a
                  bit overkill, I wanted to illustrate that composable streams
                  work well in many use cases. Breaking up logic into streams
                  can help create separate and composable pieces of logic that
                  can stem from complicated UIs. Components that subscribe to
                  changes in the streams are able to react to one source of
                  truth rather than having to check for side-effects in
                  lifecycle methods such as
                  <code>componentDidUpdate</code>. I think that they are a great
                  way to remove some of the anti-patterns we see in React
                  components and to avoid the performance costs of a large Redux
                  store.
