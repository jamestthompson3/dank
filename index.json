I\u0026rsquo;ve been frustrated with the lack of organization options present in Spotify. When I create a new playlist for myself or for a friend, I usually have a vibe or theme in my mind. It can be hard to then scour through songs and albums that aren\u0026rsquo;t already in a playlist with a similar theme. Music tagger allows you to paste in the link from Spotify or Tidal and then categorize the song/album as you wish.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMusic tagger was also an opportunity to work on a non-trival sized Go application, which helped me learn a lot more about the language and was very fun! The application is far from complete (I really don\u0026rsquo;t like the name :p), but you, dear reader, are free to use it and send me feature requests or bug reports! I will be updating it according to my needs and feedback I get from others.\u003c/p\u003e\n","desc":"Check in on what I've done for Webtober this year.","permalink":"https://teukka.tech/posts/2025-10-28-webtober-week4/","section":"posts","tags":["webtober","programming"],"title":"Webtober 2025 Week 4 Roundup - Music Tagger"},{"contents":"\u003ch1 id=\"intro\"\u003eIntro\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is the first year that I\u0026rsquo;m trying to publish something on or for the web for the month of October.

I want to discuss my vision for the tool and ideas around knowledge management. The main goal of Tendril Wiki is to collapse the tools I use for managing information into a single, unified platform. The functionality in Tendril Wiki arises from my own personal needs or from features I\u0026rsquo;ve seen other platforms / tools implement and wanted for myself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs satisfying as it is to have \u0026ldquo;Taylor\u0026rsquo;s random interests and needs\u0026rdquo; driven development, I would invite you, the reader, to download Tendril Wiki and tell me what you like, what you hate, and what strange and wonderful paths down which you\u0026rsquo;d like your thoughts to carry your tools. This post is meant to be a wishlist and a place for me to think out loud, perhaps in a year from now I\u0026rsquo;ll have accomplished the features discussed here, or I\u0026rsquo;ll be shaking my head while thinking about how different things turned out.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"reducing-friction\"\u003eReducing friction\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe modal style of editing notes is one of the biggest annoyances I\u0026rsquo;ve had with Tendril Wiki, and it prevents using my notebook as a scratchpad like with tools such as Roam Research or Logseq. Tendril Wiki supports interstitial journaling and adding to your daily note from the home page, but you cannot view what you have already written for the day while simultaneously adding new information. To do this, you must first click the link for the daily note page and click the edit button.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo reduce this friction, I want to implement an editor which removes the barrier between viewing and editing and allows you to click on the blocks you want to edit instead of changing the modal view for the entire document. A new, non-modal editor necessitates more client-side JavaScript code, and in an effort to keep performance reasonable, I am accompanying the editor changes with a simplified wikitext syntax. Inspired by projects like Subtext, the new wikitext syntax follows the \u0026ldquo;you aren\u0026rsquo;t going to need it\u0026rdquo; (YAGNI) principle to reduce the parsing and processing needed on the client side.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAdopting a reduced wikitext syntax reinforces the idea that notes are not meant to be formatted for complex presentation like a published blog post or essay. Notes are comprised of lines (or as they are called in the new Tendril Wiki paradigm, blocks) and published documents are comprised of notes that are synthesized and laid out in a particular manner by their author. By preventing notes from having the ability to contain complex formatting, writers can be more focused on the content of the note and less focused on implementing complex layout structures or templates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParing down the wikitext syntax also opens up the door for expressive block types. In the current version of Tendril Wiki, all blocks are text, and their content needs to be evaluated and transformed by the markdown parser to be properly rendered in the case of multi-media / special embed blocks. Since there is no way to indicate \u003cem\u003ewhich\u003c/em\u003e special case should be handled ahead of time, the process ends up being a lengthy and hard to read code block for parsing out bits of text and matching them to their proper multi-media render format.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith a content-type header, blocks or notes explicitly specify their type, making it faster and easier to build out custom rendering solutions for content like YouTube videos, Code Sandbox editors, or links to a podcast episode. Content-Type headers also allow blocks to be shared to others, allowing their tools to parse and display the content as it suits them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"collections\"\u003eCollections\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI use an external service to make my browser bookmarks sorted and tagged, and ensure that I\u0026rsquo;m able to search the full text content of everything I bookmark. Until recently, the service I use for managing bookmarks did not have a way to associate notes about the webpage with the bookmark itself. One of my goals with Tendril Wiki is to take the features I like about my bookmark manager and merge them with my note taking tools. Tendril Wiki supports bookmarking URLs and it attempts to download and archive a copy of the webpage the page\u0026rsquo;s contents appear in the Tendril Wiki search results. The next step in bookmark management is to improve the user experience surrounding bookmarks and collections in general.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn Tendril Wiki, everything is a note. Bookmarks, tags, and even your todo list is a note. The \u0026ldquo;everything is a note\u0026rdquo; paradigm works well until you have a collection of items you want to edit and display in a format besides a backlinked note. This shortcoming is evident if you have many bookmarks in Tendril Wiki and try to manage them by via the bookmark note that each bookmarked URL is tagged with upon creation. If you extend the UX paradigm to other pieces of information you would like to collect (think images like Pinterest or videos from around the web), the usability degrades even further.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a composition of smaller pieces of data, collections are a lens into content which exists in your notebook. In a sense, collections hold the state of a filter/aggregator function, label the function, and describe the layout rules for displaying the content which meets the filter/aggregate criteria. An open ended specification allows collections to evolve as both the types of content in your notebook your thoughts about the content evolve. This means that collections become notes which contain logical rules concerning which pieces of content to gather from your collection, and how to display them.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"feeds\"\u003eFeeds\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMy eyes have become two hungry mouths pressed against the\nTerrarium window [the screen between the material world, the Terrarium, and cyberspace] through\nwhich electronic pulses reach the receptive areas of my brain. My brain seems to require a daily\ninput of several billion bytes of digital (light-speed) information.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eTimothy Leary, \u003cem\u003eChaos and Cyberculture\u003c/em\u003e 1994\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNetworked feeds are a primary source of information for what Leary dubs, \u0026ldquo;homo sapiens electronicus\u0026rdquo; (Chaos and Cyberculture, 45), and should addressed as part of any software which manages personal knowledge in a digital world. The first target for feed integration into Tendril Wiki will be RSS. Reading articles from RSS feeds side by side with your notes in Tendril Wiki allows you to take notes without jumping between tabs or applications. By offering the ability to annotate and curate information from RSS, Tendril Wiki allows you to take a more active role in information consumption.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTendril Wiki is not a purely navel gazing platform, and therefore must facilitate both the consumption and production of streams of information. You are able to publish your notebook as a static site, with each note compiled into its own standalone HTML page. Static compilation on the scale of individual notes allows you to share the entire notebook or select parts. Static site publishing, however, is not a swift enough stream of information to qualify as a feed, which means Tendril Wiki\u0026rsquo;s publishing capabilities must be augmented to include syndication. In addition to consuming RSS feeds, Tendril Wiki should offer the ability to syndicate select notes to an RSS feed to allow others to read what you share. Syndication targets should not be limited to RSS feeds, and one of the long term goals of Tendril Wiki is to allow you to syndicate to the Noosphere.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"into-the-noosphere\"\u003eInto the Noosphere\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe Noosphere is a project which aims to produce a global knowledge graph (\u003ca href=\"https://subconscious.substack.com/p/noosphere-a-protocol-for-thought\"\u003eSubconscious Substack\u003c/a\u003e) powered by IPFS. The Noosphere is a protocol rather than a platform, it is not a silo which traps your data, nor is it an mandatory part of using Tendril Wiki. Instead, your Tendril Wiki server can become a gateway to the Noosphere, allowing you to federate or consume content, keep (encrytped) backup copies of your notes on IPFS, and sync with other Noosphere client applications you use.

Tendril Wiki has served as a place for me to experiment with tooling ideas, gain more experience using the Rust programming language, and copy concepts from other tools for thought. After 18 months, I want to reflect on what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned and where I can improve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"limits-of-markdown\"\u003eLimits of Markdown\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMarkdown was my first choice in the backing file format of Tendril Wiki for a few reasons:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003col\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eeasy to parse\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003equick to get started building a wiki (reading and writing plaintext files is trivial)\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003edoes not require a rich text editor\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eplaintext files integrate well with external tools.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ol\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUsing markdown for the backing file format allowed for quick initial iterations, and simple custom extensions to the syntax (such as \u003ccode\u003e[[Wiki Page]]\u003c/code\u003e to link pages). As I wanted to add more advanced features to notes and create a richer text editing experience, I ran into some of the limitations of the markdown format.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA system which operates on data must be able to associate context with that data. This context informs the system or its operators how the data is processed. This pattern of context association via metadata appears in different forms (think EXIF for photos, \u003ca href=\"https://subconscious.substack.com/p/if-headers-did-not-exist-it-would\"\u003eheaders for HTTP / email\u003c/a\u003e, tags for notes, etc) and is most useful when the metadata specification is open-ended, allowing systems to implement and consume the context they find most beneficial. From a knowledge management perspective, different types of notes have different metadata associated with them. Notes about books have an author, notes referring to an article on the web have the associated URL, and all notes have information such as creation time, id, modification time, and tags.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe CommonMark markdown specification does not have a way to add headers or metadata. As a result, headers became the first extension I had to implement. I decided to go with the same format used by the static site generator, \u003ca href=\"https://jekyllrb.com/\"\u003eJekyll\u003c/a\u003e where headers are colon separated key-value pairs at the beginning of the document and contained between \u003ccode\u003e---\u003c/code\u003e as delineators. Tendril Wiki can execute specific actions depending on the metadata contained in the note headers. One drawback to this metadata approach and to the markdown format in general is that headers contain the metadata for a whole markdown document, making it hard to atomize chunks of the document as separate logical blocks. This means being able to compose notes as blocks of thought becomes difficult without the use of a rich text editor which handles atomization and block scoping automatically. Without under the hood data composition and decomposition, the user must manually create and link multiple small markdown files to achieve the nesting and composition from more popular tools like Roam Research, Notion, and Logseq.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"file-cabinet-vs-scratchpad\"\u003eFile Cabinet vs Scratchpad\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI have kept a personal wiki for over two years now, and I\u0026rsquo;ve amassed hundreds of notes varying in length from a few lines to dozens of paragraphs. Searching through this aggregated knowledge is very helpful, especially with the search engine that comes with Tendril Wiki. Yet, I have noticed that my personal wiki is more a tool for thoughts to reside, rather than a tool for thinking. When sketching out an idea or keeping track of my debugging progress, I often use the interstitial journaling feature of Tendril Wiki which allows you to fire and forget a thought from the home page. A fundamental friction arises from this workflow that strikes at the heart of the tools for thoughts vs tools for thinking dichotomy: Tendril Wiki has read and a write modes which need to manually activated to add or review your thoughts. A much better approach to achieving the breakthrough power of the scratchpad is to have the line between read and write mode eliminated, allowing users to view and edit the rendered text inline.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRich inline editing combined with automatic block creation and linking improves a tool like Tendril Wiki, and shifts the momentum away from archival and more towards jotting down ideas that are composed later. To achieve this, I would need to implement a rich text editor for Tendril Wiki which would both remove friction from creating and editing text as well as make it easier to break ideas up into smaller, composable blocks. These blocks could then have associated block types which could be composed into collections (imagine bookmarked articles or videos in a table format), or essays, or blog posts, or tweets. The lack of rich inline editing and automatic data decomposition are the two biggest weaknesses in the Tendril Wiki architecture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"javascript-not-required-sort-of\"\u003eJavaScript Not Required (sort of)\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the start of the Tendril Wiki project, I had an interested in how far I could push HTML and CSS towards making a featureful application without the use of JavaScript. Approaching client-side development through this lens helped in validating ideas and getting initial features working quickly, but did not lead to the best outcome for future development. I have tried to use \u0026ldquo;progressive enhancement\u0026rdquo; where the application works without the use of JavaScript and where JS sprinkled lightly on top of the application adds quality of life features. This definition of progressive enhancement works well for simple text editing, keyboard shortcuts, and automatic uploading of images pasted into a note, but is not adequate for an application that requires rich inline text editing.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen rich editing comes to Tendril Wiki, the current application where JS does not need to be present for it to be functional will be hidden in a \u003ccode\u003e\u0026lt;noscript\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e tag. Doing this will allow me to redefine progressive enhancement to mean the page loads in quickly with most of the UI elements in place, and when the JS loads, it unlocks the advanced functionality expected from a feature rich, modern web application.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"whats-next\"\u003eWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to continue pushing Tendril Wiki forward to be a tool for thinking as well as a tool for thoughts.

Discovering peers directly removes the necessity of a centralized server architecture, reducing the number of network jumps your packets require to share information with each other. Peer discovery can be used in: discovering microservices in the same docker network or kubernetes cluster, file sharing (like airdrop and bittorrent), and peer to peer gaming. Eliminating a centralized communication server can reduce operating costs, improve communication times between clients, and lead to more robust services since there is no single point of failure. Taking advantage of the benefits listed above requires a decentralized architecture.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"multicast-groups\"\u003eMulticast Groups\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMulticasting is one of the tools we can use in creating a decentralized system. Multicasting is the process where messages are sent to a group of participants on the network. Multicasting differs from Broadcasting by only sending data to a specified \u003cem\u003egroup\u003c/em\u003e of network nodes, whereas broadcasting sends data to all network nodes. Implementing multicasting incurs a distinct set of challenges compared to centralized architectures; consider the following listed by Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s article about \u003ca href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2003/cc759719(v=ws.10)\"\u003eIPV4 Multicasting\u003c/a\u003e:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMulticast traffic is sent to an ambiguous group destination.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBecause group addresses represent different groups with different members, group addresses generally cannot be summarized in the IP multicast forwarding table.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe location of group members is not consistent, so the IP multicast forwarding table might need to be updated whenever a group member joins or leaves a multicast group. Multicast routing protocols update the IP multicast forwarding table.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause the challenges like those listed above, reasoning about multicast traffic requires different mental model than a traditional client-server architecture. A critical concept in multicasting the \u003cem\u003emulticast group\u003c/em\u003e. A multicast group can be compared to a chat application: membership is dynamic; members can leave and join at will, group members can be located anywhere on a multicast enabled network (compared to a server with a static IP address), a host can be a member of as many multicast groups as desired. A multicast group \u003cem\u003ecan\u003c/em\u003e have a well known address, for example 224.0.0.1 is the multicast address for all hosts in the subnet.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eMembers of multicast groups listening for incoming traffic will first bind their UDP socket to an available interface and join the multicast group. After joining the group, this member can receive datagram packets on the bound interface without the other members of the group knowing it\u0026rsquo;s specific IP address. A similar process goes for multicast group members sending data to the group. Senders will bind their UDP socket on an available interface and begin transmitting datagram packets to the multicast group address. Through the magic of multicasting, the sender does not require information other than the group address for their packets to reach group members who are listening for incoming data.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"diving-into-the-code\"\u003eDiving into the code\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo start multicasting over UDP requires only a few lines of code.

Nobody wants to be spammed with notifications, especially when no explanation of what type of events will trigger the notifications or how often they will be sent is given.

This has the advantage of being off the main thread, which means that the logic is non-blocking and can be accessed via a global singleton for component based frameworks such as React, allowing all components to trigger notifications. One of the disadvantages of using a web worker for notifications is that the notifications are not triggered if the user closes the tab.

Like me, you may be familiar with service workers from the role they play in creating Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), or from seeing them registered as part of the build output of \u003ccode\u003ecreate-react-app\u003c/code\u003e. While this automatic output from build tools such as \u003ccode\u003ecreate-react-app\u003c/code\u003e is very useful in getting started with PWAs, using the Service Worker API is much more beneficial to your application when tailored to your use cases. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive into the Service Worker API to see how it provides a better user experience in some common use cases, starting with caching network responses.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA great place to start for any Web API is the MDN Page. In the case of the Service Worker API, MDN offers the \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API\"\u003efollowing paragraph\u003c/a\u003e as an introduction:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cblockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eService workers essentially act as proxy servers that sit between web applications, the browser, and the network (when available). They are intended, among other things, to enable the creation of effective offline experiences, intercept network requests and take appropriate action based on whether the network is available, and update assets residing on the server. They will also allow access to push notifications and background sync APIs.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/blockquote\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince service workers act as a man in the middle between the browser, network, and your application, their potential is huge! However, this means that the potential for abuse is also huge, and to combat this abuse, browsers have built in security measures around the Service Worker API. Some of these security measures are: service workers are \u003cem\u003eonly\u003c/em\u003e registered over HTTPS or from your \u003ccode\u003elocalhost\u003c/code\u003e, and only registered from the same origin as the current page. Working in Firefox, you enable service workers over HTTP in your developer tools console, and inspect and debug registered service workers in \u003ccode\u003eabout:debugging\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"cache-money\"\u003eCache Money\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eContent Caching is a great starting point for utilizing service workers, and tools like \u003ccode\u003ecreate-react-app\u003c/code\u003e implement by default. Caching static assets is one of the first steps in creating a PWA. Let\u0026rsquo;s dive into caching by looking at the code for caching this blog for offline use!

The interesting part of this code is the function that gets called on the \u003ccode\u003einstall\u003c/code\u003e event. Installation is the first event in the \u003ca href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerState\"\u003eservice worker lifecycle\u003c/a\u003e, it gets kicked off by the \u003ccode\u003eregister\u003c/code\u003e function in \u003ccode\u003eindex.js\u003c/code\u003e.

When our service worker is activated, we want to delete the old cache and install the current version of the files denoted in the \u003ccode\u003ePAGES\u003c/code\u003e array in the new cache. The function, \u003ccode\u003edeleteOldCaches\u003c/code\u003e gets all of the cache keys (which are the old versions of \u003ccode\u003eCACHE_NAME\u003c/code\u003e), and checks them to see if they match the format we\u0026rsquo;ve given to our \u003ccode\u003eCACHE_NAME\u003c/code\u003e. We don\u0026rsquo;t simply clear \u003cem\u003eall\u003c/em\u003e the keys in the cache because we may have several service workers running at a time, and clearing their data may have unintended consequences, so this service worker only removes data that it has placed in the cache itself.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eInstalling the new versions of the blog posts requires opening a cache with the key of \u003ccode\u003eCACHE_NAME\u003c/code\u003e, and using the \u003ccode\u003eaddAll\u003c/code\u003e method to specify that we want to add everything in the \u003ccode\u003ePAGES\u003c/code\u003e array to be added. After deleting old versions of the cache and installing the latest posts, the \u003ccode\u003eclients.claim()\u003c/code\u003e call allows the current service worker to become the active service worker on all pages in its scope.

The conditions we are checking before responding with cached response are: if the request is a navigation event (loading this blog post in your browser for example), or if the browser requests additional resources like CSS, Javascript, or images. To illustrate this flow, we\u0026rsquo;ll take a look at two different resources requested by this website, \u003ccode\u003evimtip-gitlens.html\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003ebb8_1.svg\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince \u003ccode\u003evimtip-gitlens.html\u003c/code\u003e is specified in the \u003ccode\u003ePAGES\u003c/code\u003e array we cached on service worker activation, we\u0026rsquo;ll look at it first. When you navigate to \u003ca href=\"https://teukka.tech/vimtip-gitlens.html\"\u003ethe post\u003c/a\u003e, the \u003ccode\u003eevent.respondWith\u003c/code\u003e function is executed with the value from \u003ccode\u003ecacheResponse\u003c/code\u003e being evaluated. Using \u003ccode\u003eevent.respondWith\u003c/code\u003e tells the service worker to intercept the request and respond with the argument passed to this function. Let\u0026rsquo;s step through the \u003ccode\u003ecacheResponse\u003c/code\u003e function: we first open the current cache (as denoted with the \u003ccode\u003eCACHE_NAME\u003c/code\u003e) and check to see if there are any entries for the URL of the incoming request. If we\u0026rsquo;ve cached this URL before, we return the cached response\u0026ndash;avoiding a network call. If the service worker can\u0026rsquo;t find the URL from its cache, then makes a network request and places the response into the cache while returning the \u003cem\u003ePromise\u003c/em\u003e containing the response back to our main application. Putting the response in the cache is wrapped inside \u003ccode\u003eevent.waitUntil\u003c/code\u003e to ensure that the browser does not interrupt the service worker while updating.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"wrapping-up\"\u003eWrapping up\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe final step in this example is making sure that the service worker always reflects the most up to date content.

Proxies are valuable in this context since our request client\u0026rsquo;s API reflects our schema, thus allowing the schema to serve as both validation and documentation. Another advantage to schema driven API definitions is that automated tools are able to generate and update the schemas based on microservice API docs, minimizing the work needed to stay in sync with other services to which we are making requests.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"designing-the-api\"\u003eDesigning The API\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSince this a client for managing requests to different microservices, we want the API to reflect the supported HTTP methods and service name of each URL.

\u003ccode\u003eManager\u003c/code\u003e class is performed by the \u003ccode\u003eaccessInterceptor\u003c/code\u003e function. It takes a function as an argument and returns a proxy. The interceptor function is called by the proxy whenever we try to access a property of the target object (which in this case is just an empty object). Using the interceptors on property access allows the object to dynamically take whatever shape we want, which in snippet above, is \u003ccode\u003emanagerClassInstance.schemaPath.httpMethod\u003c/code\u003e. Because the first interceptor function checks whether or not the property attempting to be accessed is defined in the provided schema, if we were to try and access a non-existent property on the example schema like \u003ccode\u003eusers\u003c/code\u003e, the \u003ccode\u003eManager\u003c/code\u003e class instance throws a \u003ccode\u003ePathNotInSchemaError\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy using the \u003ccode\u003eaccessInterceptor\u003c/code\u003e function, we are able to chain methods according to our schema.

id=\"off-the-main-loop-async-actions-within-neovim\"\u003eOff The Main Loop: Async Actions within Neovim\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNeovim embeds the libuv library in the editor and exposes lua (and to some extent vimscript through the \u003ccode\u003ejobstart\u003c/code\u003e function) bindings for interacting with the library\u0026rsquo;s API. This allows actions in the editor to happen asynchronously, keeping the main editor loop clear for user input. What this means practically for users is that actions which take a long time such as grepping through large projects, generating ctags, or linting can now be done in the background without blocking the user\u0026rsquo;s ability to keep editing text.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLet\u0026rsquo;s explore how to use the libuv lua bindings in Neovim to create useful asynchronous actions. I will cover two examples: using the \u003ca href=\"https://pandoc.org\"\u003epandoc\u003c/a\u003e program to convert a markdown file to html, and using \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep\"\u003eripgrep\u003c/a\u003e to search within a project. Both of these examples use the libuv bindings differently, but still illustrate well the capabilities of libuv inside Neovim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"first-example-convert-markdown-files-with-pandoc\"\u003eFirst Example: Convert Markdown Files with Pandoc\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePandoc is a powerful tool for converting files into and different formats. I write many Markdown documents and it is useful to convert them into HTML for my blog. In order to do this in an asynchronous way, we will use \u003ccode\u003evim.loop\u003c/code\u003e from Neovim\u0026rsquo;s lua library. I would recommend going through the documentation on \u003ccode\u003evim.loop\u003c/code\u003e as you code along with this post.

message: \u003ccode\u003elua/tools.lua:122: E5560: vimL function must not be called in a lua loop callback\u003c/code\u003e. In order for any vim functions to be called within a lua loop callback, they need to be wrapped in \u003ccode\u003evim.schedule_wrap\u003c/code\u003e. Wrapping vim functions in \u003ccode\u003evim.schedule_wrap\u003c/code\u003e is necessary since it schedules the callbacks to be invoked when it is safe, bridging the gap between the libuv event loop and the internal Neovim main loop. To learn more about \u003ccode\u003evim.schedule_wrap\u003c/code\u003e, check out \u003ccode\u003e:h schedule_wrap\u003c/code\u003e.

In the \u003ca href=\"https://neovim.io/charter/\"\u003eNeovim charter\u003c/a\u003e, it lists one of its goals as developing a first-class lua scripting alternative to VimL. One of the reasons for doing this is that VimL is a slow interpreted language with almost no optimizations. Much of the time spent in vim startup and in actions from plugins that can block the main loop in the editor is in parsing and executing vimscript. A great explanation of this can be found in Neovim lead maintainer, Justin M. Keyes\u0026rsquo; talk, \u003ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bt-vmPC_-Ho\"\u003eWe can have nice things\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWith the recent introduction of the built-in LSP client in the master branch written in lua, I became more interested in the possibilities lua has to offer and began trying to use lua in Neovim. I have never written lua before and have not seen very many guides on how to utilize the lua runtime in Neovim, so I want to illustrate the process of learning how to take advantage of the powerful scripting capabilities that are available in the Neovim runtime. Given that my experience is still very basic, these examples will also be quite small, but I hope that it can be a good jumping off point for those interested in using lua more in extending Neovim.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"getting-started\"\u003eGetting Started\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the first things I was confused about was how to use lua code inside of vim and vimscript. Luckily, the documentation in \u003ccode\u003e:h lua\u003c/code\u003e gives a few examples of how lua can be used in the editor. I recommend reading it for an in-depth explanation of how Neovim treats lua and the sourcing of lua files. Here\u0026rsquo;s a high-level overview of different approaches to executing lua code in your editor:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eFrom the vim command line, you can run \u003ccode\u003e:lua \u0026lt;yourCodeHere\u0026gt;\u003c/code\u003e. This is useful for keybindings, commands, and other one-off execution cases.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInside of a VimL file, you can demarcate lua code with the following code fencing:\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-viml\" data-lang=\"viml\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003elua \u0026lt;\u0026lt; EOF\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e-- your lua code here\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003eEOF\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eInside of a VimL file you can use the \u003ccode\u003elua\u003c/code\u003e keyword to execute commands similar to the first example.

Additionally, it will append your runtimepath with \u003ccode\u003e/lua/?.lua\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003e/lua/?/init.lua\u003c/code\u003e so it is common practice to see a \u003ccode\u003e/lua\u003c/code\u003e sub-directory inside \u003ccode\u003e.nvim\u003c/code\u003e.

The ability to fetch data from some service and display it to users is an important part of building a framework to support these applications. In order for our components to do this, we need to refactor. Our component calls \u003ccode\u003emount\u003c/code\u003e when we want to render it on the page, but this function only serves to attach styles and event handlers to the component, not fetch data asynchronously. To accommodate actions taken after our component has been defined, but before it is actually rendered, we need a new method: \u003ccode\u003ecomponentDidMount\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ccode\u003ecomponentDidMount\u003c/code\u003e method will be called just before the component\u0026rsquo;s initial render.

After the project is complete,\nI hope to compile the blog posts to be more cohesive and structured.\u003c/p\u003e\n","desc":"Introduction to the frontend framework project","permalink":"https://teukka.tech/posts/2019-09-09-build-your-own-frontend-framework/","section":"posts","tags":["javascript","frontend","learning"],"title":"Build Your Own Frontend Framework, Introduction"},{"contents":"\u003ch2 id=\"power-to-productivity\"\u003ePower to Productivity\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVim is a powerful tool which helps you stay productive and spend less time doing the mechanical work of coding.\nFor many, Vim seems archaic, under-featured, or even intimidating. I hope to illustrate that Vim none of those things, but is in fact a great editor for nearly every development environment.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI want to focus on three common tasks where Vim helps you be more productive without leaving your editor. These tasks are: navigation between files, and searching / replacing.\nNo Vim experience is necessary for this post, but it definitely helps if you are at least familiar with the basics through \u003ccode\u003evimtutor\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"navigation-between-files\"\u003eNavigation Between Files\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne of the most common and time consuming activities we do as developers every day is jump between files.\nIf you are using a more traditional text editor such as VSCode, Sublime Text, or Atom, chances are you spend more time that you would like\nscanning through your directory tree trying to find the right file. With Vim, the secret to file navigation begins with \u003ccode\u003eset path\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ccode\u003epath\u003c/code\u003e is where Vim searches for files when executing the various search commands. By default on Unix-like systems, it is \u003ccode\u003e.,/usr/include,,\u003c/code\u003e. Let\u0026rsquo;s break this down a bit. The first \u003ccode\u003e.\u003c/code\u003e indicates that Vim should include files relative to the current file\u0026rsquo;s directory.\nDirectories that should be searched are separated by commas, so the next place Vim will look by default is the \u003ccode\u003e/usr/include/\u003c/code\u003e directory.\nThis directory typically contains headers so it can be useful if you are doing C and C++ programming. The final sequence of \u003ccode\u003e,,\u003c/code\u003e instructs Vim to search in the current directory.\nOut of the box, we are able to search a large part of our project. What if we wanted to search downward recursively through our project?\nIt is common to open your text editor in your project root ( often denoted by a vcs file such as a \u003ccode\u003e.git\u003c/code\u003e folder ).\nTo ensure that Vim finds all of our project files when we search for them, we use \u003ccode\u003e*\u003c/code\u003e and \u003ccode\u003e**\u003c/code\u003e.\nThe asterisks represent wildcards, with \u003ccode\u003e*\u003c/code\u003e matching 0 or more characters and \u003ccode\u003e**\u003c/code\u003e matching only directories. By setting your path to \u003ccode\u003eset path=.,,,**\u003c/code\u003e, you can ensure that Vim will search all our project files.\nOne caveat to this is that by default \u003ccode\u003e**\u003c/code\u003e only searches 30 directories deep, so if you have an extremely nested directory structure, you can increase that limit, see \u003ccode\u003e:h starstar\u003c/code\u003e for more details.\nNow that we have our path correctly set, it\u0026rsquo;s time to navigate! Vim has a built in keybinding for jumping to the file under your cursor, and it is \u003ccode\u003egf\u003c/code\u003e. We tell Vim which file endings it should add by using \u003ccode\u003eset suffixesadd\u003c/code\u003e.\nSo for frontend web development, you might have something in your \u003ccode\u003evimrc\u003c/code\u003e that looks like this: \u003ccode\u003eau! BufNewFile,BufRead *.js,*.jsx suffixesadd+=.js,.jsx\u003c/code\u003e. This allows us to jump to files with endings \u003ccode\u003e.js and .jsx\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn practice it looks like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-js\" data-lang=\"js\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#f00\"\u003eimport\u003c/span\u003e { someFunction } from \u003cspan style=\"color:#87ceeb\"\u003e\u0026#34;./utils\u0026#34;\u003c/span\u003e;\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003ePlacing your cursor in normal mode on \u003ccode\u003e./utils\u003c/code\u003e and pressing \u003ccode\u003egf\u003c/code\u003e should take\nyou to the \u003ccode\u003eutils.js\u003c/code\u003e file!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis is just the tip of the iceberg of what Vim can do when it comes to searching through your code, for a more in-depth take on this, I would recommend the blog post, \u003ca href=\"https://vimways.org/2018/death-by-a-thousand-files/\"\u003edeath by a thousand files\u003c/a\u003e.\nI want to show one more useful command that benefits from having set our \u003ccode\u003epath\u003c/code\u003e to search downward recursively and that is \u003ccode\u003efind\u003c/code\u003e. With \u003ccode\u003efind\u003c/code\u003e, Vim will search for a file and then open it for editing if the file is found. We can also use\n\u003ccode\u003e*\u003c/code\u003e wildcard expansion and tab completion if we have the \u003ccode\u003ewildmenu\u003c/code\u003e setting on.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor example, typing: \u003ccode\u003e:find N*C*.jsx\u003c/code\u003e and pressing tab would expand to \u003ccode\u003eNavigationContainer.jsx\u003c/code\u003e. You could also type \u003ccode\u003eNavigation\u003c/code\u003e and tab to expand all the options that Vim finds in the current path. Just like that, you can fuzzy search through your project without any additional configuration or plugins.\nSometimes, there are directories in the project which we would like to ignore, such as \u003ccode\u003enode_modules\u003c/code\u003e, \u003ccode\u003etarget\u003c/code\u003e, and \u003ccode\u003edist\u003c/code\u003e. Vim determines which files to ignore via the \u003ccode\u003ewildignore\u003c/code\u003e setting.\nA sample \u003ccode\u003ewildignore\u003c/code\u003e may look like this: \u003ccode\u003eset wildignore=*/dist*/*,*/target/*,*/builds/*,*/node_modules/*\u003c/code\u003e. Vim will no longer include these directories in it\u0026rsquo;s path.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"find-and-replace\"\u003eFind and Replace\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBy default, Vim ships with \u003ccode\u003evimgrep\u003c/code\u003e which allows you to search for strings within files. Vim also comes with the \u003ccode\u003egrep\u003c/code\u003e command which allows you to search\nusing an external grep tool. I personally use \u003ca href=\"https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep\"\u003eripgrep\u003c/a\u003e, a grep tool that is focused on speed and respects my \u003ccode\u003e.gitignore\u003c/code\u003e file by default.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo enable Vim to use ripgrep ( or any other grep program ) as a backend to the \u003ccode\u003egrep\u003c/code\u003e command, you need to set the grep program in your vimrc:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"highlight\"\u003e\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\" style=\"color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#000;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;\"\u003e\u003ccode class=\"language-viml\" data-lang=\"viml\"\u003e\u003cspan style=\"display:flex;\"\u003e\u003cspan\u003e\u003cspan style=\"color:#f00\"\u003eset\u003c/span\u003e grepprg=rg --smart-case --vimgrep\n\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/span\u003e\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003cp\u003eNow you have your search results loaded in the quickfix menu, and can leverage a Vim built-in plugin, \u003ccode\u003ecfilter\u003c/code\u003e. To add it, simply run \u003ccode\u003e:packadd cfilter\u003c/code\u003e and Vim will load the plugin for use. \u003ccode\u003ecfilter\u003c/code\u003e filters through entries in the quickfix list via regex.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIf you have search results that look like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cpre tabindex=\"0\"\u003e\u003ccode\u003edatastructures.html|623| 30:        mixpanel.track(\u0026#34;data structures loaded\u0026#34;);\nindex.html|61| 26:          \u0026lt;a href=\u0026#34;./datastructures.html\u0026#34;\nindex.html|62| 19:            \u0026gt;Data Structure Memes For Edgy JavaScript Teens\u0026lt;/a\n_site/index.js|64| 28:           import { customStructure } from \u0026#39;./datstructures\u0026#39;\n_site/utils.js|64| 28:           import { customStructure } from \u0026#39;custom/datstructures\u0026#39;\n\u003c/code\u003e\u003c/pre\u003e\u003cp\u003eIf you want to only keep the search results from the JavaScript files, you run this command: \u003ccode\u003e:Cfilter! html\u003c/code\u003e. This keeps everything except matches that contain\n\u003ccode\u003ehtml\u003c/code\u003e in the quickfix list. If you wanted only to keep only the third match, you run \u003ccode\u003e:Cfilter Memes\u003c/code\u003e and it keeps only matches containing \u003ccode\u003eMemes\u003c/code\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOne more useful command when using the quickfix list is \u003ccode\u003e:cfdo\u003c/code\u003e. It allows you to execute whatever command you give it across the entire quickfix list.\nFor example, if you wanted to search and replace you could do it like this:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003esearch for the phrase, \u0026lsquo;data structures\u0026rsquo;:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ccode\u003e:grep!
